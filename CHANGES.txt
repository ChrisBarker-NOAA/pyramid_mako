Next Release
============

- Change the way that custom user values passed to the renderer are merged with
  the system provided variables. This allows the user to pass in a variable
  named 'context' and have it correctly override the system provided context,
  and THEN get correctly renamed so that Mako doesn't complain about a variable
  being passed in that isn't allowed due to it being reserved.
- Drop testing dependency on ``nose-selecttests``.
- Caller-relative template lookup is now supported. To enable this feature,
  do *not* specify the ``mako.directories`` setting in your configuration.
  All templates specified as non-absolute paths will be discovered relative
  to the caller package.

0.3.1 (2013-10-22)
==================

- Re-enable lazy loading of the mako renderer, allowing the settings
  to be configured after pyramid_mako has been included, as long as everything
  happens in the same commit.

0.3 (2013-10-20)
================

- Add a new Configurator directive, ``config.add_mako_renderer`` which
  can be used to add a new mako renderer for a given extension. This
  directive accepts an optional ``settings_prefix`` to load settings and
  configuration differently per-renderer as well.

- Removed the private APIs, ``IMakoLookup``, ``MakoRendererFactoryHelper``,
  and ``renderer_factory``. See the new ``config.add_mako_renderer`` API
  for updating offending code.

- Remove dependency on ``pyramid.interfaces.ITemplateRenderer`` from
  Pyramid 1.5.
